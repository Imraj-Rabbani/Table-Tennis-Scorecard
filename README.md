# Table-Tennis-Scorecard
My First ever webpage, it is a realtively simple webpage to practice some bootstrap, and JavaScript and get accustomed to the events
function in JavaScript.
Basically this just keeps track of the score of a table tennis match (manually though :') ). Digit color changes when the winning score
and can the scorecard can be resetted
Used HTML, Bootstrap through the CDN so had to use the given colors and limtited in terms of customization, and used Javascript to built this 
webpage
